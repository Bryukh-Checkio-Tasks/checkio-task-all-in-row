<p>Sofia stepped over a pile of books on the Library floor and picked up a strange note on the librarian's desk.</p>
<p> “Hey Stephen,” she whispered.</p>
<p> “Yes?” he whispered back.</p>
<p> “What do you think this note is about?</p>
<p> “Well how should I...? Why are we whispering?” He asked getting louder.</p>
<p> “SHUSH! We are in a Library. Be quiet!” She shot the response back at him. “There’s a bunch of lists on here...”</p>
<p> “So sort them.”</p>
<p> “Now why would I do that?”</p>
<p> “Maybe because it’s a secret code or something.”</p>
<p> “That would be AWESOME!” Sofia almost shouted.</p>
<p> “Shhhh! We’re in a library!” Stephen scolded.</p>
