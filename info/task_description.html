    Nicola likes to categorize all things.
    He categorize even numbers and as result a simple sequence of numbers looks like the deep-nested list after Nicola
    processing.
    But Sophia and Stephan don't like it and would like to make out Nicola's lists. Let's help them.

<p>
    There is a list that contains integers or other lists that can contains other lists and integers etc.
    You should put all integer values into one flat list.
    The order should be as it was in the original list string representation from left to right.

<p>
    But we have to hide this program from Nicola thus your code should be shorter than 140 symbols (with whitespaces).
</p>

<p><strong>Input data:</strong> A nested list with integers.</p>

<p><strong>Output data:</strong> The one-dimensional list with integers.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br/></strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">flat_list([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
flat_list([1, [2, 2, 2], 4]) == [1, 2, 2, 2, 4]
flat_list([[[2]], [4, [5, 6, [6], 6, 6, 6], 7]]) == [2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]
flat_list([-1, [1, [-2], 1], -1]) == [-1, 1, -2, 1, -1]
</pre>
